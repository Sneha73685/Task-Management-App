# Task Management App (JAVA)

## About

This is a simple task management application implemented in Java. It allows users to manage tasks, including adding new tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and displaying all tasks.

## Key Features
1. **Add Task:**
Users can add a new task to the system. They provide details such as the task title, description, due date, and priority.
2. **Remove Task:**
Users can remove a task from the system by specifying its ID.
3. **Mark Task as Completed:**
Users can mark a task as completed. This changes the status of the task to "completed."
4. **Display Tasks:**
Users can view all tasks currently in the system. This includes details such as the task ID, title, description, due date, priority, and completion status.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: When the program starts, it initializes a TaskManager object to manage tasks.

2. **Menu Display**: The main menu is displayed, presenting users with options to perform various operations on tasks. 

3. **User Interaction**: Users choose an option from the menu based on what they want to do (add a task, remove a task, mark a task as completed, display tasks, or exit the app).

4. **User Input Validation**: The app validates user input to ensure it meets certain criteria (e.g., valid task ID, proper date format) and provides feedback if input is invalid.
